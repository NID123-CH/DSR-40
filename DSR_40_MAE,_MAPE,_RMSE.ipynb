        "\n",
        "Relative forecast accuracy refers to the measurement of forecast errors in proportion to another benchmark or standard. It provides a comparative perspective, allowing us to assess how well a forecasting method performs in relation to another method or relative to the size of the numbers being forecasted.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if you are predicting sales for a product and the actual sales are 100 units while your forecast was 105 units, the absolute error is 5 units. But the relative error might be 5% (5/100). This percentage gives a sense of scale; a 5-unit error means different things if you're discussing 100 units versus 10,000 units.\n",
        "\n",
        "The concept behind relative forecast accuracy can be crucial in various scenarios:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Comparing Different Time Series**: If you have multiple products or time series to forecast, each might be of a different scale. Using relative accuracy allows you to compare these different scales more meaningfully.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Comparing Models**: When testing multiple forecasting models, relative accuracy can help determine which model performs better proportionally, regardless of the magnitude of the actual values.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Communicating with Stakeholders**: In business contexts, stakeholders might be more interested in percentage terms (\"We're off by 5%\") than absolute values (\"We missed the forecast by 50 units\").\n",
        "\n",
        "One common metric used to gauge relative forecast accuracy is the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). It measures the average of the absolute percentage errors:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ MAPE = \\frac{100\\%}{n} \\sum \\left| \\frac{Actual - Forecast}{Actual} \\right| $$\n",
        "\n",
        "However, while relative forecast accuracy metrics like MAPE are valuable, they come with limitations. For instance, MAPE becomes problematic when the actual value is close to zero, as the denominator can cause the error percentage to inflate dramatically or become undefined."
